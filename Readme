Adversarial examples in machine learning has emerged as a focal point of research due to their remarkable ability to deceive
models with seemingly inconspicuous input perturbations, potentially resulting in severe consequences. In this study, we undertake a
thorough investigation into the emergence of adversarial examples, a phenomenon that can, in principle, manifest in a wide range of
machine learning models. Through our research, we unveil a new notion termed computational entanglement, with its ability to entangle
distant features, display perfect correlations or anti-correlations regardless to their spatial separation, significantly contributes to the
emergence of adversarial examples. We illustrate how computational entanglement harmonizes with relativistic effects such as time
dilation and length contraction ultimately results in the convergence of angular differences and distances towards zero, signifying perfect
correlation, or in opposite towards the maximum angular differences and distances, indicating perfect anti-correlation.
